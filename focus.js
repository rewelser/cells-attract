Notes:
How does my attention wander? 
I periodically cycle through my list of stressors in no apparent order. Focus is always assigned to the most pressing matter unless
the most pressing matter has an "awaiting status"--when I have exhausted all reasonable actions in an effort to resolve this stressor--
unless I anticipate the status is about to change from "awaiting" to a "take action"-themed status, where things get more complicated
and I try to anticipate possible actions I should take based on the worst-case hypothetical I can imagine, based on my priorities.
If I resolve or stalemate a concern, at that moment I typically do not go on to the next-most stressful thing immediately, as my energy
for stress is temporarily depleated. When my energy is depleated, I either focus on a comfortable distraction, or I focus on trying to
rejuvenate my energy stores. Typically these two happen concurrently, where one is secondary. 

Example: Worry about balding. Consult the mirror, document change if any, ask others, consult the internet. Usually stalemates with
the knowledge that I am to go to a specialist to determine if I am losing my hair. This worry will be revisited indefinitely, as
it has assumed the role of the primary concern. If something is deemed to pose a more immediate threat, then it will take primary, but
the previous unresolved primary will be stored as such for revisiting when the current is either resolved or stalemated, if energy 
stores allow.

Concerns are structured by how I perceive they will affect priorities of mine. These priorities fluctuate based on hormone levels;
I've noticed that concern over baldness correlates positively with sexual arousal/frustration. This is because the priority in question
given my hormonal levels is reproductive viability in terms of mating and attracting mates. It's more complicated than this, but generally
speaking.

TAKEAWAYS 
    - Does the array of foci need to conjunct with an artificial "hormone" system, that fluctuates somewhat dependantly with regard to stamina?
    - This simple system can represent and even behave like consciousness. The only bottlenecks are how concerns are traversed, how they
    are compared, and what subsequent actions can be taken. If a machine expresses ac
